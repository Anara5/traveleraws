# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory "frontend", you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

The project backend is hosted in AWS.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
I upload the build folder's static files in AWS to s3 bucket.

### Code Splitting

I splitted the code in 2 environments: backeng and frontend. Backend I uploaded to the s3 bucket and moved to the Lambda for fetching any interaction with the database: at he moment I created a table with AWS's DynamoDB for storing all registered users and operating the user's login functions and fetching their data for.

### Making a Progressive Web App

### Advanced Configuration
For the user register and login features I also used API Gateway, Incognito, AWS Amplify...

### Deployment

The deployed version for my test project is here: http://traveler-client-s3.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/
At the moments the project is still in progress, but you can still test the implemented user register/login system.
